# Adding the Subway Surfer Video

To complete the background animation with a subway surfer video:

1. Download or create a subway surfer gameplay video
2. Rename the video file to `subway-surfer.mp4`
3. Place the file in this directory (`/public/`)

The video should be in MP4 format for the best browser compatibility.

## Tips for optimal performance:
- Keep the video size reasonably small (under 10MB if possible)
- Compress the video to reduce its impact on page load times
- A resolution of 720p should be sufficient as it will be displayed with reduced opacity
- Make sure the video has no audio, or the audio is removed to avoid disrupting user experience
